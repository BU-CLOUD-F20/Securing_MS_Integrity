<Purpose>
  Provides a script that extracts the demo code snippets from README.md and
  runs them in a shell, raising `SystemExit`, if the output is not as expected.

  virtualenv setup and installation of in-toto, as described in the demo
  instructions, is not performed by this script and must be done before running
  it. Snippets are run in a temporary directory, which is removed afterwards.

  NOTE: Currently, the script runs all snippets marked as `shell` snippets (see
  `SNIPPET_PATTERN`). To exclude a snippet from execution it must be marked as
  something else (e.g. `bash` to get the same syntax highlighting).
